# InstaTech Server
An ASP.NET server for remote control, live support chat, and workstation management.

Client Repo: https://github.com/Jay-Rad/InstaTech_Client  
Website: https://instatech.invis.me

### Building
You can use the Setup.ps1 script to install InstaTech.  I'll try to write up instructions on this later.  My family is impatiently breathing down my neck.

To customize your server manually, change the properties in /InstaTech_Server/App_Code/Config.cs.  For the clients, check the comments within the client repo in files /InstaTech_Client/MainWindow.xaml.cs, /InstaTech_Service/Socket.cs, and /InstaTech_CP/app/main.js.
